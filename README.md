1.	The file /Attack on 6_7_0_1_4_5_2_3/Distinguisher.pdf is a figure describing a distinguisher on LBlock instantiated with the permutation (6,7,0,1,4,5,2,3). 

2.	MITM/MITM_SKINNY/ MITMSKINNY.py is the code for generating the model for finding MITM distinguishers of SKINNY. MITMSKINNY.py depends on the library CPMITM.py. The model R10SKINNY.lp generated by MITMSKINNY.py can be solved by the Gurobi Solver (http://www.gurobi.com/), and we provided the solution file in R10SKINNY.sol.

3.	Distinguisher_ARIA.java can be solved with the Choco Solver at http://www.choco-solver.org/.
